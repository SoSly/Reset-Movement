# Reset Movement

Reset Movement (RM) is a FoundryVTT module that allows GM users to reset the current combatant's position to their position at the start of their turn.

## Usage

The current combatant's starting position is stored as flags on the token at the start of their token's turn.

GM users can click a button on the Token Layer toolbar to reset the current combatant to the saved position.

Movement animation during reset can be disabled in module settings.
